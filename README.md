# Monk's Chat Timer
Add-On Module for Foundry VTT
It's just a bunch of little things to make the program run a little smoother and look a little better.  But a lot are based on personal preference.

## Installation
Simply use the install module screen within the FoundryVTT setup

## Usage & Current Features
Requires the module Library: Chat Commands installed.

Type /timer as a chat command and this will produce a count down timer.  `/timer 5` will add a timer that counts up 5 seconds.  `/timer -5` will count down 5 seconds.  `/timer 5:00 Send this message to the timer (Send this message after the timer is finished)` will add a timer that counts up 5 minutes and displays the first message to the chat message with the timer.  And once the timer it complete it will send a second chat message with the second message that's in parenthesis.

## Bug Reporting
I'm sure there are lots of issues with it.  It's very much a work in progress.
